#Inferno Fighters

#Brief
My first CSE project of AUST life when i was in first year second semester(1.2).
I coded a simple game in c++ using iGraphics library and use visual studio 2010(recommeded in case want to run) for code editing, compling & running.


* To check the codes of the game as well as play the game below step should be followed:
  1.download all the files.
  2.create a new solution file in visual studio 2010.
  3.Unrar the "images.rar" file.
  4.then paste all the header file in the project file+ "images" UnRared folder.
  5.run the project.

For installing visual studio 2010 properly follow the link & checkout the presentantion1.pdf & readme:
